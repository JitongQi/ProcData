\title{Extract features from action sequences by multidimensional scaling}
\usage{
seq2feature_mds(seqs = NULL, K = 2, method = "oss",
  max_epoch = 100, step_size = 0.01, pca = TRUE, tot = 1e-06,
  return_dist = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqs}{a list or a square matrix. If a list, each element is an action sequence in the form of a vector of actions. Alternatively, their dissimilarity matrix can be provided}

\item{K}{the number of features to be extracted.}

\item{method}{the dissimilarity measure to be used to calculate distance matrix. Currently available methods: \code{oss}. It implements the order-based sequence similarity in Gomez-Alonso and Valls (2008).}

\item{max_epoch}{the maximum number of epochs in stochastic gradient descent.}

\item{step_size}{the step size to be used in stochastic gradient descent}

\item{pca}{logical. If TRUE, the principal components of features are returned.}

\item{tot}{the tolerance of accuracy}

\item{return_dist}{logical. If the dissimilarity matrix should be returned. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
a list
  \item{theta}{an \code{n} by \code{K} matrix of \code{K} raw features or principal features for \code{n} sequences.}
  \item{loss}{discrepancy between estimated and true dissimilarity}
  \item{dist_mat}{dissimilary matrix}
}
