\title{ProcData: A package for process data analysis}
\description{
General tools for exploratory process data analysis. Process data refers to
the data describing participants' problem solving processes in computer-based
assessments. It is often recorded in computer log files. This package
provides two action sequence generators and implements two automatic feature
extraction methods that compress the information stored in process data,
which often has a nonstandard format, into standard numerical vectors. This
package also provides recurrent neural network based models that relate
response processes with other binary or scale variables of interest. The
functions that involve training and evaluating neural networks are wrappers
of functions in keras.

\section{Read sequences}{

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{csv2seq}} reads action sequences from a csv file.
}
}

\section{Sequence generators}{

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{seq_gen}} generates action sequences of an imaginery simulation-based item.

  \item \code{\link{seq_gen2}} generates action sequences according to a given probability
transition matrix.
}
}

\section{Feature extraction methods}{

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{seq2feature_mds}} extracts \code{K} features from action sequences by
multidimensional scaling.

  \item \code{\link{seq2feature_seq2seq}} extract features from action sequences by action
sequence autoencoder.
}
}

\section{Sequence models}{

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{seqm}} fits a neural network model that relates action sequences 
    with a response variable.
    
  \item \code{\link{predict.seqm}} makes predictions from the models fitted by \code{seqm}.
